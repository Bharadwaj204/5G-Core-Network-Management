# 5G Core Management Prototype - 3-Minute Pitch

## Opening (30 seconds)
"Today I'm presenting an End-to-End 5G Core Management Prototype - a hands-on platform for learning and managing 5G networks using industry-standard protocols."

## Problem & Solution (60 seconds)
"Students typically learn 5G theory but lack practical experience with real management systems. Real telecom equipment is expensive and complex. My solution? A lightweight, open-source 5G core using Open5GS with complete management capabilities through NETCONF, RESTCONF, and SNMP protocols."

## Key Features (60 seconds)
"The system features four core technologies: YANG models defining network data structures, NETCONF for XML-based configuration, RESTCONF for HTTP/JSON access, and SNMP for performance monitoring. It includes a real-time dashboard and comprehensive test scripts."

## Results & Impact (30 seconds)
"All components work seamlessly together, providing a complete 5G management environment. This fills a critical gap in telecommunications education, offering students hands-on experience with the same protocols used by major telecom vendors like Nokia and Ericsson."

## Closing (30 seconds)
"This prototype demonstrates that complex telecom systems can be made accessible for education while maintaining industry standards. Thank you."
